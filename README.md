# WAN_Podcast_creator
This is to create podcasts form the files created by floatplane downloader. 
The floatplane downloader you can find here: https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-Downloader

Note that you will need to have an active subscription at floatplane to be able to use the downloader.

This script will need to know where you are picking the files, and where you want to put your podcasts. This is a format that Plex can use, and is available to be used in the PlexAMP app on your device.

It will create the podcasts per year, and will number all the files based on already converted files. If you want to have full number, and do it based on the latest one, you currently need to download the entire year, and then do the conversion. 

Edit the script so you have the correct paths for you source and destination, and let the magic work.

Required package is ffmepg, so this is something that needs to be installed before using this script.
